## Featured Projects

### [Randomizing Groups Simulator](https://github.com/razahtet/RandomizingGroupsSimulator)
Constraint-based Team allocation tool that can group 200+ participants randomly while ensuring incompatible participants are not placed together in less than two seconds.

### [Shortest Path & Route Finder](https://github.com/razahtet/ShortestPathFinder)
Interactive web-based pathfinding visualizer using BFS and DFS that allows users to create nodes, search by name, and find the shortest path and all other possible routes with real-time canvas visualization.

### [Flood It Game](https://github.com/razahtet/floodit)
Custom implementation of the puzzle game **Flood It** with multiple board sizes, color sets, and a greedy-algorithm hint helper.

### [Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/razahtet/MinimaxTicTacToe)
The player can play tic-tac-toe against the computer, which will never lose against the player. It uses minimax to determine and play the next best possible move.

## In Progress

**Future Golf Score Predictor**: An interactive web app (HTML, CSS, JS) that predicts a golf player's next score based on historical performance and practice metrics by implementing and experimenting with lasso regression, random forest classification, feature selection, and other machine learning algorithms, which will be fine-tuned in the Python backend.
